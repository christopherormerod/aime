### Zotero

Open Bibliography of LLMs in Education

URL: <https://www.zotero.org/groups/5515175/llms-4-edu_public/library>

Description:

-   We’ve converted the Zotero Group into a public group, and AIMIE members can post resources/links and search for existing resources. There are currently 126 resources of empirical studies & conceptual work.

-   Welcome your additions – greatest interest is on empirical studies that apply LLMs to education context and provide measures of accuracy / insight / impact. Critical work and vendor-provided work also posted.

-   Organizing a project to conduct a broader meta-analysis and synthesis of existing work; if interested in participating, contact John ([jwhitmer\@fas.org](mailto:jwhitmer@fas.org))
