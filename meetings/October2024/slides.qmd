## AIME Updates

### NCME Annual Meeting

The theme of the 2025 NCME Annual Meeting is "Educational Measurement: In Service of Society." The theme emphasizes the "why" of our work in educational measurement and echoes the last three words of theÂ [NCME mission](https://www.ncme.org/about/about-ncme/mission): "to advance theory and applications of educational measurement **to benefit society**"

**Dates:** April 23-26, 2025

**Place:** Denver, CO
