This special issue focuses on exploring the implications of utilizing large language models (LLMs) for educational assessment, with *particular emphasis on leveraging LLMs for formative feedback provision and mitigating challenges related to academic integrity*. To this end, we invite researchers from diverse fields to submit papers investigating the use of LLMs to support the assessment process.
