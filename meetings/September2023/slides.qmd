## Assistant Professor of Artificial Intelligence in Learning and Education @ Harvard University 

The Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE) invites applications for a full-time, tenure track faculty position at the rank of Assistant Professor focused on artificial intelligence (AI) in learning and education.

We seek scholars whose research, teaching, and impact in the field will advance one or more dimensions of AI in learning and education, including but not limited to:

- Theoretical and Empirical Foundations: Investigating the foundational theoretical principles of various learning processes in relation to AI, and/or examining these through empirical studies to understand their impact on learning and cognition.

- Design: Conceptualizing, creating, and evaluating AI-based designs, such as tools or curricula used in classrooms, online platforms, and out-of-school-time settings.

---

- Practice: Analyzing the pedagogical potentials and complexities of AI, attending to learnersâ€™ present needs and preparation for future needs in life and work.

- Ethical and Societal Implications: Interrogating the ethical, historical, and cultural impacts of AI in learning and education, such as privacy and bias.

Strong applicants will be distinguished by the quality of their research, their use of rigorous methods, and the significance of their work for policy and practice.
