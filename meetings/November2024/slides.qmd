## AIME Updates

### AIME conference (Proposal).

We are submitting proposal for a Special AI in Measurement and Education Conference

Submitted by: AIME SIG Conference Organizing Committee (Joshua Wilson as Committee Chair)

**Theme:** Building Robust Evidence for AI in Educational Measurement

**Possible topics**

-   AI Applications in Measurement and Assessment

-   AI applications in Instruction

-   Ethical Issues

-   Assessment Opportunities and Challenges

-   Building Technological Expertise

We met with Rich Patz and Amy Hendrickson on November 1st regarding planning.

## AIME Updates

### NCME Annual Meeting

The theme of the 2025 NCME Annual Meeting is "Educational Measurement: In Service of Society." The theme emphasizes the "why" of our work in educational measurement and echoes the last three words of theÂ [NCME mission](https://www.ncme.org/about/about-ncme/mission): "to advance theory and applications of educational measurement **to benefit society**"

**Dates:** April 23-26, 2025

**Place:** Denver, CO

**Sessions**: Congratulations to every session organizer and participant.


## AI Evidence Hub

Evidence in AI Group has been 'curating' LLM in EDU eidence into a [public Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5515175/llms-4-edu_public) (t.ly/zg2yE).

We've connected this group into a public web portal: [aievidencehub.org](https://aievidencehub.org/lib/). Welcome feedback and contributions; synchs hourly between Zotero and Web portal.

Moving slowly with analyzing research using analysis framework; let John (jwhitmer\@fas.org) know if you're interested in contributing.

### Next Meeting

Speaker suggestions? Self-nominations welcome!
