### NCME Annual Meeting

The theme of the 2025 NCME Annual Meeting is "Educational Measurement: In Service of Society." The theme emphasizes the "why" of our work in educational measurement and echoes the last three words of the [NCME mission](https://www.ncme.org/about/about-ncme/mission): "to advance theory and applications of educational measurement **to benefit society**"

**Proposal Deadline:** Friday, September 13, 11:59PM PDT

**Dates:** April 23-26, 2025

**Place:** Denver, CO

### Call for participation

**Resource Subgroup:** We are (Still) looking to develop a resource subgroup.

The primary objectives of this subgroup are:

-   Establishing a repository of code for prompting and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) in Assessment.

## AIME Updates

### Synthesis of LLMs for Education Evidence
 
Building on the previously shared [public Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5515175/llms-4-edu_public), [Google archive version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18oWafIFc_l-jU5S6-Fktg81eRV07sVDYfrlrFJ_vS64/edit?usp=drive_link), conduct a literature review & synthesis of LLMs in Education with two goals: a) identify methods used to evaluate validity, reliability and fairness and b) set benchmarks and threshold levels. 

We have developed an [initial project scope]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w-od6u2GQjgJmWboeapaAaiLbTmMLHGKdJF8YzA5C7I/edit?usp=drive_link), and several subcommittee members (Kehinde James, Daniel Olutola, Olushola Soyoye, and John Whitmer) have begun working on it, building on discussions at NCME.
 
Our next meeting is on 6/24 @ 1pm PT; please contact Kehinde if you would like to join or add [this link](http://meet.google.com/gxs-tzwe-xga).
