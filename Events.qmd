### **Conferences**

-   [International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Education (WAIE 2023)](http://www.waie.org/) WAIE is an annual event which aims at a key theme on Artificial Intelligence and Education. WAIE 2023 is intended to provide a stimulating forum for researchers, scientists, engineers and practitioners to present their latest research findings, ideas, developments and applications in all aspects of Artificial Intelligence and Education. WAIE 2023 will include keynote addresses by eminent scientists as well as plenary, special and regular presentation sessions. Peer review of all the papers will use a blind process and acceptance will be based on quality, originality and relevance.

-   [Emerging Generative AI Trends](https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/symposium-us/conference-resources/gen-ai) Spurred on by the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, Generative AI has the potential to transform the way all enterprises do work, keep up with their competitors, and manage risk. High value use cases for Generative AI are emerging and impacting every industry and job role. CIOs must quickly understand the implications for their organizations and provide critical leadership to define their strategy and take action. Realizing Generative AI's full competitive potential will require building the right portfolio, ecosystem, deployment model, skills and governance. (October 16--19, 2023)

### **Leveraging Large Language Models for Assessment Support: Applications and Implications**

Journal: Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence (Open Access) \
Published: 28 June 2023\
Deadline: 30 October 2023\
Contact: Prof. Rafael Ferreira Mello at rflm\@cesar.org.br

URL: [Call for Papers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computers-and-education-artificial-intelligence/about/call-for-papers#leveraging-large-language-models-for-assessment-support-applications-and-implications)

This special issue focuses on exploring the implications of utilizing large language models (LLMs) for educational assessment, with *particular emphasis on leveraging LLMs for formative feedback provision and mitigating challenges related to academic integrity*. To this end, we invite researchers from diverse fields to submit papers investigating the use of LLMs to support the assessment process. We particularly encourage empirical research that employs rigorous methodologies, such as experimental studies, case studies, and surveys, to provide evidence of the effectiveness and impact of LLMs on assessment. Additionally, we welcome theoretical papers offering a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the topic and its educational implications (e.g., for ethics and trustworthiness). Overall, this special issue aims to advance state-of-the-art research by integrating LLMs in the assessment process and identifying key directions for future research in this promising area.
