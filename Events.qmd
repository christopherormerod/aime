# Active Publication Opportunities

This is a running list of potentially relevant publication opportunities for Generative AI.

## White Paper Proposal

### Call for Participation - The ethical use of AI in educational measurement

We are looking for researchers to contribute to a white paper on the Ethical use of AI in educational measurement. Examples of topics include the following:

-   Accountability when AI is used for measurement

-   Detection and mitigation of algorithmic bias when using AI for measurement

-   Transparency in the use of AI for measurement

-   Toxicity in generative AI applications

-   Regulations on the ethical use of AI for measurement

If you are interested, please email Okan Bulut at [bulut\@ualberta.ca](mailto:bulut@ualberta.ca).

# Special Issue Education and Information Technologies

Special Issue on Applications of Generative Artificial Intelligence Technologies in Education Applications of generative technologies to education are diverse and can be described through several viewpoints: Stakeholders, employment sector, ethical issues. Expected contributions include the following, but as we write this call for papers new applications appear in new contexts, so works illustrating other points of view are also welcome:

-   helpful tools for teachers, such as MCQ generators that simplify their daily tasks and save more time for direct interaction with students

-   changing teachers' and institutions' evaluation practices to avoid possible cheating and plagiarism

-   personalized advice and follow up for students, new tools available for helping them in solving many problems

-   new policies design by institutions, including new diploma architectures applications dedicated to parents

-   new curricula adapted in terms of content as well as in ways of teaching and learning

From an ethical viewpoint,

-   how to deal with potential "fakes" everywhere
-   would educators and parents accept the use of core tools applications if their underlying principles are not made public?
-   would educators and parents accept new tools if their training needs a computing power that only a handful of private world corporations can afford and that needs huge amounts of energy?
-   How does generative artificial intelligence affect progress towards the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal 4, on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all?
