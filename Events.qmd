# Active Publication Opportunities

## The 49th International Association for Educational Assessment (IAEA) Annual Conference

The 49th International Association for Educational Assessment (IAEA) Annual Conference, hosted by ETS in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., will provide an opportunity for industry thought leaders, training providers, and practitioners to examine current and recent advancements in educational assessments, focusing on the theme How Can AI Help Improve Educational Assessments? While AI has gained broader interest globally in education and beyond with the creation of chat GPT and the subsequent emergence of many other tools and applications based on generative AI, forms of AI have been used in assessments for decades, including automatic item generation for new assessments, natural language processing (NLP) or large-language model (LLM) methods for automatic scoring of essays (e.g., ETS e-rater), or onthefly individualized assessment assembly based on computer-adaptive testing (CAT).

**Place**: Philadelphia, PA

**Date**: September 22–25, 2024

## 2024 NCME Special Conference on Classroom Assessment

This year’s special conference is being co-hosted by the University of Illinois at Chicago and the Chicago Public Schools, with support from the Center for Assessment. These hosts continue NCME’s longstanding commitment to improving assessment practices that privilege deeper learning for all, and that happen directly between teachers and their students.

**Place**: Chicago, IL

**Date**: September 19-20, 2024
