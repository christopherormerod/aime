title: "Generative AI in Education and Measurement"

Welcome to the (proposed) Special Interest Group on Generative Artificial Intelligence in Measurement and Education (GAIME) with the [National Council of Measurement in Education](https://www.ncme.org/home). Our goal is to serve as an intellectual home for data scientists and psychometricians interested in the application of AI to measurement and education.

A draft of our charter can be found [here](https://christopherormerod.github.io/gaime/about.html).
